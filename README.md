# Vue.js Bambee.tech login

This project is only for use from Bambee.tech team. It uses bambee.tech login api to show an simple Vue.js implementation with unit and integration testing with Cypress.io.

My goal with this structure is to be simple and easy to understand. It doesen't uses any custom components or unnecessary modularizations.
